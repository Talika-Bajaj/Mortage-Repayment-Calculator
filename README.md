# Frontend Mentor - Mortgage repayment calculator

![Design preview for the Mortgage repayment calculator coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 29th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

In this challenge I created a mortgage calculator. This project was an excellent opportunity to practice working with forms, client-side validation, and dynamic DOM updates. I also emphasized accessibility to ensure a user-friendly experience. This challenge significantly improved my web development skills and attention to detail.

**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
